# Library-Management-System

This C program implements a comprehensive library management system, allowing users to manage book-related operations. It supports adding new books with details such as title, author, and quantity, viewing available books, issuing books to students, returning issued books, deleting books, and searching for specific books by ID. The data for books and students is stored in memory using arrays of structures. The program operates entirely within a single execution, handling user input for all operations. The system efficiently tracks issued books and their availability, ensuring smooth library management without requiring external file handling.
